Slower ball on off, on the shorter side as well. Shreyas Iyer has already given himself some room. That's like committing without knowing what is in store. Cannot retreat, it is late for him. Tries to ramp but there is no pace or the bounce to ease things for him. Ends up guiding it into the hands of Siraj at short third man. This is far from over. Delhi have not chased well and because they have not, they will need some extra effort to go past the line here. Time-out in the meantime. Shreyas Iyer c Siraj b Bhuvneshwar 33(25) [4s-1 6s-2]  "
