The third umpire will have a look, the soft signal is NOT OUT. He has taken the catch, but did he lose control of the ball later? It popped up, but did it stick in his elbow as it came down? The third umpire is having a look at various angles, none of them seem to be conclusive enough. One can't really see where the ball got lodged, did it ever touch the ground? The commentators reckon it's a clean catch, but the third umpire says it's NOT OUT. A stunning effort from Krunal and he looks shocked as the giant screen doesn't agree with him. It was a great effort, moved to his left, dived low and clasped it cleanly. As his elbows hit the ground, the ball popped up and the next view wasn't clean. Could have lodged somewhere in his body, or could have touched the ground as well. Coming to the ball, it was full and wide of off, Dhawan dragged the lofted drive to the left of mid-off "
