"  0.1    Boult to Parthiv Patel, no run, cracking shot from Parthiv. Just that he hits it straight to the fielder. Good length ball with width outside off, Parthiv drives and picks out the cover-point fielder  "
"  0.2    Boult to Parthiv Patel, no run, that's a Boult special. On a length and drawing the batsman forward before nipping it away, Parthiv was left in no man's land with a poking blade. Beaten on the outside edge  "
"  0.3    Boult to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, poor delivery from Boult to follow-up. Short, wide and Parthiv is right on top of it, cracks the cut behind square and third man was only picking it up from the rope. MI are off and running  "
"  0.4    Boult to Parthiv Patel, no run, now Parthiv is loose in his approach. Sees the space outside off and throws everything at that, only to miss it by a mile. Bit more footwork would have fetched him some runs  "
"  0.5    Boult to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, Parthiv steers it away to third man  "
"  0.6    Boult to Buttler, FOUR, inswinger which is slightly off target and Buttler puts it away with ease. Full and swinging into the pads, flicked through mid-wicket to open his account. Not a muscle moved  "
"  1.1    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, wide, Woakes too has gets a bit of movement. Starts on leg-stump and shapes it further down, Parthiv can't meet with the glance and the umpire has his arms stretched  "
"  1.1    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, no run, there was a sound as ball went past bat, but nothing from Uthappa or Woakes. Short of length angled across the left-hander, Parthiv cuts and misses. There was no appeal and Parthiv had a guilty look on his face. Need a Snicko to confirm that  "
"  1.2    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, leg byes, 2 runs, slips another one on the pads and this time Parthiv gets a bit of pad past Uthappa, short fine leg runs back and keeps it down to a brace  "
"  1.3    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, back of a length slanted across off, chopped wide of the slip fielder  "
"  1.4    Woakes to Buttler, wide, Woakes doesn't reckon that was a wide, looks back and sees where the ball went. Good length ball tailing away outside off, Buttler drives and connects with thin air  "
"  1.4    Woakes to Buttler, no run, back of a length on off, blocked to the right of Woakes  "
"  1.5    Woakes to Buttler, 1 run, short of length around off, glided away to third man  "
"  1.6    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, no run, off-speed delivery and Parthiv is deceived by the lack of pace, ages early into the drive and misses it by a mile. Goes on the bounce to Uthappa, who almost makes a mess of that  "
"  2.1    Boult to Buttler, wide, shaping away down leg, Buttler can't connect with the glance, another extra added  "
"  2.1    Boult to Buttler, no run, this time everybody go up. The bowler, keeper and every member of the KKR unit, but the umpire does not budge. Back of length and nips in, Buttler is cut into half and beaten on the inside edge. The sound was ball flicking the back thigh. Top decision from umpire Menon  "
"  2.2    Boult to Buttler, 1 run, too straight, on middle and leg, tucked away to backward square leg  "
"  2.3    Boult to Parthiv Patel, 2 runs, needless from Lynn. Good length ball outside off, Parthiv drives on the up to mid-off. He made the run with ease and Lynn decides to shy at the bowler's end, no one backing up and the extra run is stolen. Boult didn't like that  "
"  2.4    Boult to Parthiv Patel, no run, not a good ploy when the ball is swinging. Parthiv gives himself room and tries to manufacture something, but the line is outside off and it shapes away further. No chance of connecting with that  "
"  2.5    Boult to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, a shot that should make him feel better. Boult errs in his length slight and that is enough for Parthiv to punish him, driven beautifully wide of mid-off and the ball raced away to the fence  "
"  2.6    Boult to Parthiv Patel, 2 runs, looks to repeat the previos shot, but Boult had angled it in and the inside edge squirts away in front of square on the leg-side, Parthiv calls for two and gets it comfortably  "
"  3.1    Woakes to Buttler, wide, that's a harsh call from umpire Nandan. Buttler charges down while giving himself room, Woakes smartly keeps it away from his reach, was inside the tramline but the umpire didn't think so  "
"  3.1    Woakes to Buttler, wide, this was a clear wide. Once more Buttler walks away to the leg-side and Woakes fires it outside off, this cut the guideline and rightly called for  "
"  3.1    Woakes to Buttler, 1 run, back of a length on off, dropped with soft hands in front of cover and a quick single taken  "
"  3.2    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, no run, Parthiv is trying too many things to get the scoreboard moving. Slower delivery slanted across off, he tries an ugly heave to the leg-side and is beaten on the under-edge  "
"  3.3    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, no run, an encore of the previous shot. How did that miss the off-pole? Woakes can't believe it. Looks skywards in frustration. Back of length on off, Parthiv hoicks and misses, the Wankhede bounce taking it over  "
"  3.4    Woakes to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, direct hit and Parthiv was running back. Finally he connects with one of his heaves, not middled though and finds Yusuf at mid-wicket. The shy is at the bowler's end and it is way off target  "
"  3.5    Woakes to Buttler, SIX, Buttler clearly has the wood on his England team mates. Stokes in the first game and now Woakes. A little shuffle and a crouch down to scoop this length delivery over short fine. The connection was such that it travelled the distance  "
"  3.6   Woakes to Buttler, 2 runs, Lynn is holding his arm and walking off. KKR fans you don't have to read what is coming up next. Fuller and just outside off, Buttler goes for the loft down the ground, toe-ends it over mid-off. Lynn backtracks and dives full length, almost got a fingertip to the ball, but the main part is that he landed badly and did not even get up to retrieve the ball which stopped inside the rope. It was his left shoulder. Meanwhile, the batsmen only run a couple of runs. They had a chance to run four, but the pair showed good sportsmanship. Lynn straightaway called for the physio. He knew that something serious had happened "
"  4.1    Narine to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, rank long hop to start Narine's spell, Parthiv picked the bones out of the pull shot, rocks back and nails it wide of the mid-wicket fielder. No need to run for those  "
"  4.2    Narine to Parthiv Patel, 2 runs, offie turning away and Parthiv opened the bat face to steer it wide of the slip fielder, two taken  "
"  4.3    Narine to Parthiv Patel, no run, glanced to short fine and the duo don't risk a single  "
"  4.4    Narine to Parthiv Patel, no run, comes down the track and makes room as well, is too close to the ball and ends up chopping it towards backward point  "
"  4.5    Narine to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, steered to short third man and Buttler was a tad late in setting off. But since the fielder was Yusuf he made it in quite comfortably, even beating the direct hit  "
"  4.6    Narine to Buttler, no run, short and outside off, Buttler cuts and finds cover-point in the way  "
"  5.1    Kuldeep Yadav to Parthiv Patel, no run, wrong 'un to begin his spell. Parthiv had no clue about it, he was shaping to play the cut thinking the ball would spin away, cramped for room and under-edged it near his feet, luckily the ball does not roll back  "
"  5.2    Kuldeep Yadav to Parthiv Patel, wide, fired down leg and Parthiv can't meet with the pull  "
"  5.2    Kuldeep Yadav to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, once more the googly cramps Parthiv for room, bunted in front of cover and sharp run taken  "
"  5.3    Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, no run, tossed up on off, Buttler prefers to hang back and defend  "
"  5.4    Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, 1 run, charges down and drags the heave along the ground to deep mid-wicket  "
"  5.5    Kuldeep Yadav to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, short and turning away, Parthiv pulls wide of mid-on. He should have played the cut there  "
"  5.6    Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, 1 run, Buttler is happy to tap and run and not take any risk against Kuldeep. Parthiv responds to his call of a quick single and the duo ease through it  "
"  6.1    Narine to Buttler, 2 runs, the new opening combo for MI has registered a 50-run stand in only their second game together. Buttler works it away with the spin wide of long-on and the second was on  "
"  6.2    Narine to Buttler, no run, did that keep a touch low? Buttler certainly thought so. He crouched low and blunted it out to the off-side  "
"  6.3    Narine to Buttler, no run, knuckle ball and Buttler knocks it to cover  "
"  6.4    Narine to Buttler, SIX, Buttler surely picked that from Narine. It was the off-spinner and he played it with the turn, plants his foot across and whips it over the cow corner fence for a maximum. This was more timing than power from the Englishman  "
"  6.5    Narine to Buttler, 1 run, flatter and around off, punched down to long-off  "
"  6.6    Narine to Parthiv Patel, no run, quicker and darted across the left-hander, Parthiv stays low and has a swipe at that, beaten on the under edge. He is struggling with his timing today  "
"  7.1    Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, 1 run, touch short and just outside off, slapped to long-off  "
"  7.2    Kuldeep Yadav to Parthiv Patel, SIX, finally Parthiv connects with one and sends it into the crowd. Floated up just outside off, Parthiv sinks to one knee and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. GG certainly didn't like it  "
"  7.3    Kuldeep Yadav to Parthiv Patel, out Lbw!! Kuldeep can't be kept quiet for too long these days. He provides the first breakthrough for KKR and ends Parthiv's hit-and-miss innings. It was the wrong 'un and Parthiv shuffled across to sweep, missed and is rapped on the pads. The question was whether the impact was in-line, umpire Nandan thought so and raised his finger. Parthiv Patel lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 30(27) [4s-3 6s-1]  "
"  7.4    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, FOUR, a freebie from Kuldeep to welcome Rana. Googly which is short and down leg, Rana went for the big pull and under edge it fine. The man in the deep was square and had no chance  "
"  7.5    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, 1 run, flighted on off and middle, Rana sweeps it to deep backward square leg  "
"  7.6    Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, 1 run, tossed up on off, Buttler prods forward to defend, the ball catches takes the inside edge and rolls to the on-side  "
"  8.1    Rajpoot to Buttler, no run, angled in on off and middle, turned gently to mid-wicket  "
"  8.2    Rajpoot to Buttler, no run, back of a length on off, Buttler moves across and misses the tickle, the ball brushes the thigh pad on the way to Uthappa, who tumbles to his left to stop the ball  "
"  8.3    Rajpoot to Buttler, out Lbw!! Two wickets in two overs. The bowling change has worked for KKR and GG. The UP lad gets rid of the dangerous Buttler, who makes a start and gets out, again. A full toss that tailed back in, Buttler was beaten for pace as he missed the flick. The ball struck him in front of leg-stump. Not sure if it would have gone on to hit the sticks. But the finger was raised and he walks back. Buttler lbw b Rajpoot 28(22) [4s-1 6s-2]  "
"  8.4    Rajpoot to Rohit, no run, greets the MI skipper with a yorker length delivery on off-stump. Squeezed out to mid-on  "
"  8.5    Rajpoot to Rohit, 1 run, short of length around off, Rohit stands tall and punches to sweeper cover  "
"  8.6    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, no run, angled away and bit of movement as well, Rana with laden feet has a poke at that only to be beaten on the outside edge. Excellent start from Rajpoot, just a single and the wicket of Buttler  "
"  9.1    Narine to Rohit, no run, knuckle ball which is short and outside off, Rohit toe-ends the cut to Yusuf, who makes a half stop and doesn't know where the ball went  "
"  9.2    Narine to Rohit, no run, again Narine is tad short in his length, Rohit waits on the cut and finds Kuldeep at backward point, another fumble from the KKR fielder, but no harm done as the ball was close to Kuldeep  "
"  9.3    Narine to Rohit, 1 run, flatter and just outside off, punched square on the off-side  "
"  9.4    Narine to Nitish Rana, 1 run, drifts onto the pads, clipped through mid-wicket, for a single  "
"  9.5    Narine to Rohit, out Lbw!! Rohit is not walking. He's not pleased with the decision. Has some choice words to say to umpire Nandan. ""That's an absolute shocker,"" says KP on air and he's right. Massive inside edge onto the pad. Two poor decisions in two overs might have just cost MI the game. The off-break which turns back in and cramps Rohit for room, he hurriedly brings his bat down and smashes it into his pads. The umpire didn't spot it and gave it out after a thought. Rohit was fuming after the decision. Even showed his bat to the umpire gesturing he hit it. But you can't overturn an onfield decision unless you have the DRS and that is not available in the IPL. This wicket has to be the game changing moment. Rohit lbw b Narine 2(6)  "
"  9.6    Narine to Krunal Pandya, no run, quicket and on the stumps, defended into the off-side  "
"  10.1    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, no run, Rajpoot's getting a little shape here. Tails it away from off on a full length, Rana defends to cover  "
"  10.2    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, no run, back of a length at the stumps, blocked  "
"  10.3    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, 1 run, wants to loft it down the ground but gets it right off the toe-end and spoons it in front of long-on  "
"  10.4    Rajpoot to Krunal Pandya, no run, the short of length delivery rushes Krunal as he swivels outside the line of it looking to help it on its away. Big appeal from Rajpoot who thinks there was a bit of glove but there was nothing there  "
"  10.5    Rajpoot to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, this time Krunal is in position much quicker, the line is different too - more around off and middle - and he's able to muscle the pull away through mid-wicket  "
"  10.6    Rajpoot to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, consecutive fours to finish the over. MI desperately need some momentum here. I think Rajpoot is getting a bit carried away. Bowls it full on the pads and Krunal whips him over mid-wicket  "
"  11.1    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, no run, quickly goes down for the reverse-sweep, hits it well but hits it straight to short third man  "
"  11.2    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, 1 run, nice bowling. Tosses the chinaman up wide of off and Rana has to reach out for the drive. He mistimes it to long-off  "
"  11.3    Kuldeep Yadav to Krunal Pandya, 3 runs, a nice little dink from Krunal for three. He waited for the ball to come to him, played it very late and dabbed it fine of short third man. The fielder gives chase and flicks it back in  "
"  11.4    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, no run, it lands right in the blockhole outside off and Rana jams it into the pitch  "
"  11.5    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, FOUR, a little bit of air from Kuldeep, Rana quickly bends his knees and swipes it to the wide long-on boundary. The length was a bit too full from Kuldeep there  "
"  11.6    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, SIX, oh what a shot! 23 off the last two overs now. A good little burst from these two. Kuldeep still flights the ball up, the line is outside off and Rana goes through the line to cream it beautifully over extra-cover. What timing on that. Way into the stands  "
"  12.1    Rajpoot to Krunal Pandya, out Caught by Uthappa!! Rajpoot has strangled him down leg. What a lucky breakthrough to end a fledgling partnership. Back of a length on leg-stump, Krunal tries to help it along into the fine leg boundary but the deflection is only a small one. A faint little tickle off the inside edge straight to the keeper. Krunal Pandya c Uthappa b Rajpoot 11(6) [4s-2]  "
"  12.2    Rajpoot to Pollard, no run, slanting in with the arm to rap Pollard on the pad. Huge appeal. But Pollard had come a long way down the pitch. The ball also had a big angle, and would have easily missed leg  "
"  12.3   Rajpoot to Pollard, 2 runs, tucks this away behind square, he's placed it in the gap and those huge strides of his take him comfortably back for the second "
"  12.4    Rajpoot to Pollard, SIX, all the way. If you're going short to Pollard, it better be nice and high. This one sits up around his chest and he dismisses it from his presence over the mid-wicket boundary  "
"  12.5    Rajpoot to Pollard, no run, back of a length outside off, Pollard steers it to backward point  "
"  12.6    Rajpoot to Pollard, no run, crunching yorker from Rajpoot. A real fizzer this. It zips through the air outside off and beats Pollard even before he jams down on it  "
"  13.1    Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Rana stoops across and sweeps it down to long leg  "
"  13.2    Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard, no run, flat on the stumps, Pollard bunts it back down the pitch  "
"  13.3    Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard, no run, the googly this time, sliding on from outside leg, Pollard doesn't seem to be picking it off the hand. As a result, he can't really be aggressive. So he waits on it and defends  "
"  13.4    Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard, no run, uh oh! A bad mix-up there with Pollard being sent back from the middle of the pitch. But he makes it home. The throw isn't a great one from Pathan either. Rana called him initially but then backtracked as Pollard steered it to point. These are nervy times  "
"  13.5    Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard, 2 runs, now a misfield in the deep. It's been knocked straight to Suryakumar at long-on who just takes his eyes off it and fumbles. Extra run  "
"  13.6    Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard, no run, flat and turning back in from a length on middle, Pollard is stuck in the crease as he defends  "
"  14.1    Woakes to Nitish Rana, 1 run, takes the pace off the length delivery on leg-stump, Rana works it through mid-wicket  "
"  14.2    Woakes to Pollard, FOUR, Woakes bowls short first up to surprise him, but Pollard is quickly into position. He's able to swivel outside the line of the ball which is on leg-stump and helps the pull to the fine leg boundary. It's rocketed through  "
"  14.3    Woakes to Pollard, 1 run, length ball at the stumps, Pollard bunts it down the ground to long-on  "
"  14.4    Woakes to Nitish Rana, no run, that's gone a long way off the thigh pad. Skiddy back of a length delivery on leg, Rana is beaten by the skid on the ball and is late on the slog. The ball pops up straight to short fine leg. No appeal from KKR  "
"  14.5    Woakes to Nitish Rana, 1 run, doesn't get hold of it. The ball was right in the slot to be clobbered but Rana miscues it down to long-on  "
"  14.6    Woakes to Pollard, no run, big swing and a miss. Clever line from Woakes to keep it well outside off. Even someone with Pollard's wing-span fails to reach out. It's well within the wide guideline too  "
"  15.1    Narine to Nitish Rana, 1 run, darts the off-spinner on leg-stump, Rana works it through mid-wicket  "
"  15.2    Narine to Pollard, 1 run, oh he saw him coming there. Might even have been a seam-up from Narine. Absolutely fired it in and nearly yorked Pollard who is somehow able to jam it back down to long-on  "
"  15.3   Narine to Nitish Rana, 1 run, Woakes does really well to get his body behind the ball. It was a tricky one as he initially went for the catch from deep square leg but realized that the ball was bouncing well short. A miscue from Rana off the slog-sweep "
"  15.4    Narine to Pollard, no run, he's bowling well here. Pollard comes down again and he pulls the length back, Pollard somehow reaches out and glances to short fine  "
"  15.5    Narine to Pollard, 1 run, another miscue from the batsman. Only a single to deep mid-wicket  "
"  15.6    Narine to Nitish Rana, no run, goes for a slog-sweep but misses. What an over from Narine. Just four singles off it. He's pushed that required rate to 15. Big pressure on Mumbai now  "
"  16.1    Woakes to Pollard, out Caught by (sub)Rishi Dhawan!! What a huge wicket right after the break. The major threat of Pollard is gone, and KKR will really back themselves now to seal this. Not sure if this was the plan, or Woakes just executed it incorrectly. He bowls it short and wide, Pollard throws his bat at and the top-edge flies down for a comfortable catch to third man. Massive moment. Pollard c (sub)Rishi Dhawan b Woakes 17(17) [4s-1 6s-1]  "
"  16.2    Woakes to Nitish Rana, 1 run, cuts his fingers across the off-cutter and gets a little grip from a short of length. The ball takes a thick edge as Rana slashes and drops on the bounce to third man  "
"  16.3    Woakes to Hardik Pandya, 1 run, short of length just outside off, chopped to extra-cover  "
"  16.4    Woakes to Nitish Rana, FOUR, moves away from the line of the short of length off-cutter, creates some room and flays it away over extra-cover. Rana keeping Mumbai afloat  "
"  16.5    Woakes to Nitish Rana, 1 run, Woakes botches a run-out opportunity! He just had to collect the ball cleanly. Rana was well short. Rana couldn't find any elevation as he tried to flat-bat the back of length delivery and he hit it straight to mid-off. Never a run there, but the non-striker had come a long way down so Rana obliged. Would have been gone  "
"  16.6    Woakes to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, that's been absolutely spanked through extra-cover. The ball has left a vapour trail. Short and wide from Woakes, Pandya smokes it while backing away  "
"  17.1    Boult to Nitish Rana, leg byes, 1 run, oh dear, he's missed a full toss. A little bit of bat on it and it would have run away. Instead, it slants in and hits him on the thigh. Would have gone down leg, so no appeal  "
"  17.2   Boult to Hardik Pandya, 1 run, it's a length ball but it's a wide length ball and Pandya drags it through mid-wicket off the inside half. Premeditated slog across the line not working "
"  17.3    Boult to Nitish Rana, FOUR, brilliant timing! Low full toss wide of off, Rana reaches out and slices it past backward point. It skimmed off the bat  "
"  17.4    Boult to Nitish Rana, SIX, 10 off 2 balls. This game isn't over yet. Not while Rana is there. Boult is struggling to execute the yorker. He delivered a low full toss last ball, now a proper full toss at the stumps. Rana picks it away effortless over long leg  "
"  17.5    Boult to Nitish Rana, 1 run, well bowled. A smart leg-cutter, rolling his fingers over the top of the ball and getting some extra bounce. It hits Rana high on the bat and he mistimes the heave to deep mid-wicket  "
"  17.6   Boult to Hardik Pandya, SIX, length from Boult and it disappears way back over mid-wicket. The MI dugout is on its feet. What a blow from Pandya. But this is ordinary death bowling. Seam-up and good length, right there in the slot "
"  18.1    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, SIX, lapped over the keeper for six! Thrilling stuff. Rana has stooped across and picked this full toss from middle-stump. It came right off the middle  "
"  18.2    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, FOUR, full toss again and this time he lofts it over extra-cover. Although the timing isn't quite there, he just had to clear the fielder in the circle. No chance for the fielder running across from sweeper cover. It's fifty for Rana too. The crowd going bonkers  "
"  18.3    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, wide, now when he nails the yorker, he's bowled it down leg. The nerves are jangling  "
"  18.3    Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, out Caught by Narine!! That roar from Rajpoot drowned the whole of Wankhede by itself. Rana backs away to a low full toss on middle and spears it straight to point. He had timed the pants off it but couldn't have found the fielder any better. His stunning innings comes to an end. Oh what a game! Nitish Rana c Narine b Rajpoot 50(29) [4s-5 6s-3]  "
"  18.4    Rajpoot to Harbhajan, 1 run, nails the yorker on off, Harbhajan stays leg-side of it and squeezes it down to third man  "
"  18.5    Rajpoot to Hardik Pandya, SIX, low full toss again and Hardik flogs it over square leg. He is 18 off 5. What a blinder!  "
"  18.6    Rajpoot to Hardik Pandya, 1 run, brings out the cutter, Hardik smartly plays it down to long-on to keep strike  "
"  19.1    Boult to Hardik Pandya, leg byes, 2 runs, gets away with a full ball on leg as he's able to beat Hardik for pace. Hardik misses the slog and the ball deflects off his pad to the right of fine leg. He hares back for the second  "
"  19.2    Boult to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, that is probably the blunder which will cost KKR the match. It shouldn't have been any more than a single. A low full toss which Hardik can't find any elevation with. He smacks it down to long-on, where Surya attacks the ball nicely but he misfields and the ball sneaks through  "
"  19.3    Boult to Hardik Pandya, no run, good sharp bumper from Boult, catching Hardik off guard a bit. He rushes his head away from the line and hunkers underneath  "
"  19.4   Boult to Hardik Pandya, 2 runs, this is very, very ordinary from KKR in the field. The substitute Rishi Dhawan is the culprit this time. He drops a skier. Another brilliant short ball, rushes Hardik on the pull and takes a thick top-edge to deep square leg. Dhawan looks nervous under the ball, slips a bit and then has to dive to his left after the misjudgement. Makes a hash of it "
"  19.5    Boult to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, full on the pads, and Hardik has done it! He whips it away past a diving Rajpoot at the fine leg boundary before running down and cutting a pose for the camera  "
